# Introduction
Patch for tuxedo-drivers with compatibility check removed.
Based on https://gitlab.com/evorster/clevo-drivers, but designed as a patch file instead of a repository fork.
Use at your own risk.

# Usage
This is designed purely to run on Arch as a PKGBUILD, and the PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO are cloned in the AUR.
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/clevo-drivers-dkms-git
Please install using your favourite AUR helper - e.g `yay -S clevo-drivers-dkms-git`.
If you have a broader use case for this package and require something not Arch-specific, please feel free to log an issue.
